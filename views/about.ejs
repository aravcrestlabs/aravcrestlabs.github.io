            <h1>About <span class="accent">AravCrestLabs</span></h1>
            <p class="legal-meta">Forged in the Aravali, Built for Excellence</p>

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                The Aravali mountain range has witnessed millennia of history, standing resilient through countless
                epochs. These ancient mountains, India's oldest geological formation, inspired our name and our mission:
                to create software that stands the test of time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Arav"</em> means peaceful and wise in Sanskrit. <em>"Crest"</em> represents the summit — the
                highest point of achievement. Together, <strong>AravCrestLabs</strong> embodies our commitment to
                crafting elegant, enduring solutions with wisdom and care.
            </p>

            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                AravCrestLabs is a solo development studio founded with a singular vision — to empower jewelry
                businesses with technology as refined as their craft. We're not a faceless corporation; we're a
                dedicated developer who genuinely cares about your success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based in Jaipur, Rajasthan — India's gem and jewelry hub — we understand the industry from the inside
                out. This proximity to the jewelry trade informs every feature in GemCrest, making it uniquely suited to
                the real challenges faced by Indian jewelers.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Flagship Product: <span class="accent">GemCrest</span></h2>
            <p>
                GemCrest represents years of research, development, and refinement. Built specifically for the Indian
                jewelry market, it understands the unique challenges you face — from GST compliance to managing complex
                inventory with varying purities and weights.
            </p>

            <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>

                    you need.</li>
                <li><strong>Direct Support:</strong> When you contact us, you talk to the developer, not a support

            </ul>

            <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
            <p>
                We're committed to continuous improvement. GemCrest isn't a "set it and forget it" product — it evolves
                based on real feedback from real jewelers. Your lifetime license includes updates that make the software
                better, never obsolete.
            </p>

                every day.
            </p>
